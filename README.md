Hello, I'm Orcus
I'm looking to get into programming and coding.
In the past I have used block based coding and some python, but now I am learning python to it's fullest extent!
I am almost halfway through the course.
My goal is to create a fighting game or an RTS!
I am not very good at coding though, so I am not open to any collaborations
