Hello, I'm Orcus.
I'm looking to get into programming and coding.
In the past I have used block based coding and python, but now I am starting a course on Java
My goal is to create a fighting game or an RTS!
I am not very good at coding though, so I am not open to any collaborations.
I am planning to use Unity or to create my dream games!
